# LoadHive Data Flow Setup Guide

This guide will help you fix the data flow issues and ensure proper communication between shippers and carriers.

## ðŸš¨ Problem Summary

The main issues were:
1. **Broken Data Relationships**: Shipments weren't properly linked between shippers and carriers
2. **Missing Sample Data**: No test data to verify functionality
3. **Incorrect Database Queries**: Poor data fetching logic
4. **Role-based Access Issues**: Carriers couldn't see available shipments

## âœ… Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fixes
- Added proper foreign key constraints
- Created indexes for better performance
- Fixed RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Added database functions for data access

### 2. Sample Data Creation
- Comprehensive sample data for testing
- Realistic Africa-Europe logistics scenarios
- Multiple user roles and relationships
- Bidding and tracking data

### 3. Service Layer Implementation
- Centralized data access logic
- Proper error handling
- Type-safe interfaces
- Role-based data filtering

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

Run these migrations in your Supabase project:

```bash
# Apply all migrations in order
supabase db push
```

The migrations will:
- Fix data relationships
- Add proper indexes
- Create sample data
- Set up RLS policies

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor
3. Verify these tables exist:
   - `profiles`
   - `companies`
   - `vehicles`
   - `shipments`
   - `bids`
   - `tracking_events`
   - `payments`
   - `documents`
   - `notifications`

### Step 3: Check Sample Data

1. In Supabase Table Editor, check:
   - **profiles**: Should have sample users
   - **shipments**: Should have 10+ sample shipments
   - **bids**: Should have sample bids
   - **vehicles**: Should have sample vehicles

### Step 4: Test Data Flow

1. **Login as Admin**:
   - Email: `admin@demo.com`
   - Password: `demo123`

2. **Open Data Tester**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Click "Data Tester" button
   - Run "Fetch Stats" to see data counts
   - Run "Test Shipment Flow" to verify data relationships

### Step 5: Test User Roles

#### Test as Shipper:
1. **Login**: `shipper@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Create Shipment**: Go to Shipper Dashboard â†’ Create Shipment
3. **Verify**: Shipment should appear in "My Shipments"

#### Test as Carrier:
1. **Login**: `carrier@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Browse Loads**: Go to Carrier Dashboard â†’ Browse Loads
3. **Verify**: Should see available shipments from shippers
4. **Place Bid**: Click "Bid Now" on any shipment

#### Test Bidding Flow:
1. **As Shipper**: View bids on your shipments
2. **As Carrier**: Place bids on available shipments
3. **Verify**: Real-time updates and notifications

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No shipments visible to carriers
**Solution**:
1. Check shipment status is 'posted'
2. Verify RLS policies are correct
3. Run "Initialize Sample Data" in Data Tester

### Issue: Bids not appearing
**Solution**:
1. Check bid status is 'pending'
2. Verify carrier has proper role
3. Check RLS policies for bids table

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify Supabase real-time is enabled
2. Check subscription setup in components
3. Ensure proper channel names

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**:
1. Check foreign key constraints
2. Verify user IDs exist in profiles table
3. Run database migrations again

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow Verification

### Expected Data Flow:

1. **Shipper creates shipment**:
   ```
   Shipper â†’ Create Shipment â†’ Status: 'posted' â†’ Available to carriers
   ```

2. **Carrier sees shipment**:
   ```
   Carrier â†’ Browse Loads â†’ See 'posted' shipments â†’ Can place bids
   ```

3. **Bidding process**:
   ```
   Carrier â†’ Place Bid â†’ Shipper sees bid â†’ Shipper accepts/rejects
   ```

4. **Shipment assignment**:
   ```
   Shipper accepts bid â†’ Shipment status: 'assigned' â†’ Carrier can track
   ```

### Verification Checklist:

- [ ] Shippers can create shipments
- [ ] Carriers can see available shipments
- [ ] Bidding system works
- [ ] Real-time updates function
- [ ] Role-based access works
- [ ] Data relationships are correct
- [ ] Sample data is loaded
- [ ] All migrations applied
